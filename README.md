# Hi there! I'm Prasanna.

Welcome to the repo for my personal portfolio.

I built this site to serve two purposes: to showcase my 9+ years of experience as a Senior React & React Native Developer, and to have a dedicated playground for experimenting with modern web animations and UI trends.

I'm currently based in Abu Dhabi, looking for opportunities to build scalable enterprise apps.

## About the Design
I wanted something that felt clean but "alive." I went with a Glassmorphism aesthetic because I love how it adds depth without clutter. The idea was to make the content pop while keeping the background dynamic.

* Frosted Glass: Used extensive backdrop filters for that premium feel.
* Fluid Motion: Every element fades or slides in using Framer Motion—no jarring page loads.
* Mobile First: Since I'm a mobile dev at heart, it works perfectly on your phone.

## The Tech Stack
I kept the stack lightweight but powerful. No heavy bootstrap libraries, just pure React goodness.

* Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router) - for that blazing fast SEO and server components.
* Styling: Tailwind CSS - because writing vanilla CSS in 2025 feels like a chore.
* Animation: Framer Motion - for the scroll reveals and hover effects.
* Icons: Lucide React - clean, lightweight SVGs.
* Language: TypeScript - strict typing saves lives!

## How to Run This Locally
If you want to poke around the code or use this as a template, feel free!
